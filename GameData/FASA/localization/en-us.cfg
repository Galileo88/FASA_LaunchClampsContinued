    #FASAlaunchClamp125  = TT00-FASA 1.25m Redstone Launch Clamp
    #FASAlaunchClamp125_desc  =  Rockets getting stuck? Use the "Redstone Clamp", it attaches to the bottom of small 1.25m rockets.

    #FASAlaunchClamp25 = TT00-FASA 2.5m Redstone Launch Clamp
    #FASAlaunchClamp25_desc = The 2.5 clamp attaches to the bottom of 2.5m rockets. Just make sure your engine can handle the weight. If your rocket explodes your going to need to add some radial clamps.  

    #FASAlaunchClampApollo  = TT19-FASA Apollo Launch Clamp
    #FASAlaunchClampApollo_desc  = Similar to the clamps that held the Saturn V down while the engines spooled up. The clamp had a special hood it retracted into. It protect the clamps from rocket exhaust so they could be reused for multiple launches.

    #FASAlaunchClampAtlas  = TT20-FASA Atlas Launch Clamp
    #FASAlaunchClampAtlas_desc  = The "Atlas Clamp" attaches to the sides of rockets to help stop the launch wiggles.

    #FASAUmbilicalTower  = TT50-FASA Umbilical Tower
    #FASAUmbilicalTower_desc  = This umbilical tower functions as a launch clamp and fuel pump for liquid fuel/hydrogen, oxidizer and mono-propellent. It also Provides electricity. Right click on the tower to start the fuel flow.

    #FASAlaunchTower  = TT66-FASA Launch Tower
    #FASAlaunchTower_desc = This launch tower lets you load Kerbals from the tower to your spacecraft.  Load it up with Kerbals from the astronaut complex and right click on the doors at the top or bottom to EVA.
