This is a continuation of Frizzanks FASA LaunchClamps. It is a stand alone mod consisting of only the launch clamps from the amazing FASA pack. While FASA itself is too large for me to fix and repackage, I am happy to work on the launch clamps.

Thanks to CobaltWolf, who's configs made this repackage almost effortless.

To Install, just drop the FASA folder into your GameData folder.

FASA is now CC-BY-NC-SA (as part of the condititions of transfer of FASA to NathanKell when frizzank departed KSP modding).
This repackage will retain that license.
